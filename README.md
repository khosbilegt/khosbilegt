I'm a Full-Stack Developer with over 5 years of professional experience based in Sydney, NSW. My red flag is reading a sci-fi, cautionary tale and saying: I kinda wanna make it.

I know a little bit of everything, but know a bunch about software architecture, backend and DevOps. Web, mobile, AI, SaaS, Cloud, Infra etc etc. If you can name it, I probably know at least a little about it. If I'm quiet for any extended amount of time, that's probably me researching about it until I seem like I know a bit about it.

[Llama Drover](https://github.com/khosbilegt/llama-drover) /WIP - INACTIVE/ - A distributed load balancer and coordinator for Large Language Model (LLM) inference nodes. Llama Drover intelligently routes LLM requests to the fastest available nodes in your cluster, mainly to route production traffic to development PCs that are often considerably powerful than most rented VPS in smaller startups.
[Plutio](https://www.plutio.com/) - DevOps & AI Consulting in a CMS for freelancers, integrating an MCP server for an AI chat feature and debugging crash causes on MeteorJS project on Google Cloud and AWS.
[PrimaxAI](https://primaxai.io/) - Landing Page for an Australian startup in the real estate space. Developed in NextJS and used ThreeJS for visual flair. Integrated ElevenLabs.

[Physics Simulator: Render Engine](https://github.com/CG-Lab-NUM/PhysicsSimulator) - Physics Simulator written in C++ using Vulkan API. Physics engine incomplete but render engine is almost complete.
