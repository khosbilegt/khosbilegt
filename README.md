# Full-Stack Engineer

![Banner](https://images4.alphacoders.com/856/thumb-1920-856858.jpg)

I'm a Full-Stack Engineer with over 5 years of professional experience based in Sydney, NSW. My red flag is reading a sci-fi, cautionary tale and saying: I kinda wanna make it.

I know a little bit of everything, but know a bunch about software architecture, backend and DevOps. Web, mobile, AI, SaaS, Cloud, Infra etc etc. If you can name it, I probably know at least a little about it. If I'm quiet for any extended amount of time, that's probably me researching about it until I seem like I know a bit about it.

## Project Showcase
Some projects I've worked on or am working on that can be found publicly in no particular order (I've got ~5-6 more complex projects hidden away in a corporate company's internal codebase):

- [Orbit: Dating Optimized](https://www.useorbitapp.com/) /ACTIVE/ — Current day job where I'm working on revolutionizing modern dating by leveraging AI and exposing the algorithm behind it for all to see.
- [Wallstream](https://github.com/khosbilegt/wallstream) /WIP - ACTIVE/ — Wallstream is meant to allow people to subscribe to someone else's wallpaper, where if they change theirs, yours downloads the new one and sets it on your computer. Or if you're a nerd like me that wants all his devices to have a synced wallpaper across ecosystems that actively hate each other (this repo was made by Windows/Mac/Linux simultaneous user gang).
- [Llama Drover](https://github.com/khosbilegt/llama-drover) /WIP - INACTIVE/ — A distributed load balancer and coordinator for Large Language Model (LLM) inference nodes. Llama Drover intelligently routes LLM requests to the fastest available nodes in your cluster, mainly to route production traffic to development PCs that are often considerably powerful than most rented VPS in smaller startups.
- [Plutio](https://www.plutio.com/) — DevOps & AI Consulting in a CMS for freelancers, integrating an MCP server for an AI chat feature and debugging crash causes on MeteorJS project on Google Cloud and AWS.
- [PrimaxAI](https://primaxai.io/) — Landing Page for an Australian startup in the real estate space. Developed in NextJS and used ThreeJS for visual flair. Integrated ElevenLabs.
- [Tokotoko](https://tokotoko.app/) — Maori learning platform for an NZ-based client that encourages learning the language via transcriptions/subtitles.
- [Guyuk: Metaverse](http://guyuk.mn/) — Worked on Mongolia's first Metaverse in Unreal Engine 4/5, mostly focusing on C++ development to enable various optimizations and API connectivity that required expertise outside Game Development.
- [Data Compass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9RGMCFELU4) — MCP Server and RAG used to query Australian government data. Entry in [Govhack](https://govhack.org/), the largest data hackathon in the southern hemisphere.
- [Physics Simulator: Render Engine](https://github.com/CG-Lab-NUM/PhysicsSimulator) — Physics Simulator written in C++ using Vulkan API. Physics engine incomplete but render engine is almost complete.
- [Chatclock](https://github.com/khosbilegt/chatclock) — Chrome Extension to show a chat partner's time zone for all the folk chatting with people in other timezones. Currently all data is stored locally in Chrome.
- [MQ Timetable Exporter](https://github.com/khosbilegt/mq-timetable-exporter) — A Chrome Extension that allows Macquarie University students to export their timetable from the Class Registration window in the student portal to iCalendar (.ics) format.
- [Space Pilot: Microsoft Kinect Game](https://github.com/khosbilegt/UE4-SpacePilot) — Motion-controlled Space Shooter game utilizing Microsoft Kinect (via a custom plugin) and built in Unreal Engine. Find out play tests and more on my YouTube channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuF38_t82_k)
- [World Population Treemap](https://khosbilegt.github.io/world-population-treemap/) — Saw a wildly inaccurate version of a treemap on Reddit and ended up building an accurate one using data from the World Bank. React + Vite web app that visualizes world population by country as a treemap, with data from 1960 to 2024. Each rectangle represents a country, sized by its population for the selected year.
- [Github to Mermaid](https://github.com/khosbilegt/github-to-mermaid) — GitHub to Mermaid turns raw commit statistics from the GitHub API into clean, shareable diagrams.
- [E-Lottery](https://github.com/khosbilegt/elottery) — Math-based tool for predicting the probability for the Mongolian VAT Lottery.
- [JsSIP with Custom Headers](https://github.com/khosbilegt/JsSIP) — Had to embed custom values in the websocket for a SIP server's custom authentication. Forked the library and started using it for a call center software's authentication.
- [Avatar Creator](https://github.com/khosbilegt/AvatarCreator) — A project for an AI course that extracts the features of a face geometrically and generates a face from pre-made 3D models. Simple write-up in research paper format in Mongolian [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a9TM1EF_eyNjFv2_iN6LGt7M6piuDLad/view?usp=sharing)
- [HoloEd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=volX4J6SB6M) — Virtual classroom for physics experimentation to understand common formulas, such as free fall and simple thermodynamics formulas. Entry in [DXCup](https://dxmongolia.org/), a business model competition for high school to bachelor students, utilizing digital transformation technology to encourage creativity, problem-solving and entrepreneurial skills.
- [Management 101 Presentation](https://khosbilegt.github.io/MNGT202-Principles-Of-Management/) — A website made as an alternative to a PPT file for a Management course back during my undergrad years.

## Project Trust-Me-Bro
Projects I've worked on under the scope of previous roles that aren't currently public or cannot be publicized due to their nature (not secretive, just no way to expose them publicly).

- Call Center SaaS - I developed a no-code tool to automate workflows, designing both the frontend and backend portions to efficiently manage incoming and outgoing calls. Used React (React Flow), Java and Asterisk PBX.
- Data Processing Pipeline & Dashboard - Built it with TimescaleDB (Postgres), Apache Kafka and in-house ETL tool I developed in Java, alongside a dashboard viewer based in React similar to Apache Superset.
- Face Validation Pipeline - Built it for on-site branches of the company with Java and AWS Amazon Rekognition, handling 100,000+ monthly verifications.
- HA Kubernetes Cluster - Setup production-ready, high-availability Kubernetes cluster with metrics in Prometheus + Grafana stack.

## Education
I try to upskill myself as much as possible and I have grand delusions of a PhD at a certain point in my life.

- Bachelor's in Computer Science @ the National University of Mongolia (2020 - 2023)
- Master's (Coursework) in Artificial Intelligence @ Macquarie University (2025 - Present)
- Master's (Research) @ ??? (???? - ????)
- PhD @ ??? (???? - ????)

## Webnovels
I've also had a brief career as a webnovel author on [RoyalRoad](https://royalroad.com/) across a number of pen names. Retired due to increasing workload at university, and following that, a full-time job. Made a couple hundred dollars which made me double down on freelancing.
